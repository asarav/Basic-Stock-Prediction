# Long Term Stock Prediction!
The following offers predictions of a chosen number months into the future to predict given a stock ticker.
The prediction is the first day of the month.
E.g., if it is October 25th, if you select 1 month, you will get the prediction for November 1st.
If you select 2 months, you will get the prediction for December 1st and so on.

## How to interpret output:
The graph shows a visual representation of the quality of predictions generated by the model.
The lower the error values are, the more likely the predicted price is to be accurate.
Generally, the higher the variance score, the better.
